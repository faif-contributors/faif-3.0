# FaiF 3.0 
Free as in Freedom is a book about the life of Richard Stallman written by Sam Williams in 2002.

Free as in Freedom 2.0 is a revised edition by Stallman perself in 2010.

Free as in Freedom 3.0 is a progressive collection the revised edition of 2010 in multiple languages (English, Finnish, Indian, etc.) on multiple formats (.epub, audiobook formats, written/published by a publisher). This project will act as the central communication point of all things FaiF. Should this project fall apart somehow, we plead the next project to be named 4.0 or something distinguishing from the our possible failure.

We seek to spread the word of software freedom in as many languages as possible and as many formats, ebook/audiobook sellers (Audible, Kindle, etc.) as possible.

Help is needed <3 contribute however you like and make it your own!

It seems like my source epub of 2.0 is just a transcode from the 2.0 pdf to epub inside Calibre. Might require a lot of cleaning up to do now that ace also knows about the accessibility issues on the book. Yeaah this definitely confirms the pdf theory

Oh boy do I have a lot of cleaning up (bikesheddink) ahead of me.

not sure should i gitignore .pdf and .epub. At the same time I don't want "duplicate" data i.e. epub and unarchived epub code but at the same time I might not also want to use the Release page of GitHub and a maintenance-needing CICD pipeline on GHActions. Not sure how I should collaborate with jollheef or should I just leave their project alone.
